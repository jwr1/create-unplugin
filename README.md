# create-unplugin [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-unplugin)](https://npm.im/create-unplugin)

Initialize a new [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin) package.

## Usage

Make sure you are in an empty directory, then run the following with your package manager.

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm create unplugin@latest
```

With Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn create unplugin
```

With PNPM:

```bash
$ pnpm create unplugin
```

Then follow the prompts!

The plugin name automatically infers the recommended package and export names. After specifying the names, you can choose the language for your project (JavaScript or TypeScript) and then pick what bundlers you want your plugin to support.

After you complete the prompts, your project files will be generated, and the dependencies will be installed.
